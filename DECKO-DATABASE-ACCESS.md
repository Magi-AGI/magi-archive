# Accessing Decko Data via Remote Console

**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Environment**: Production Decko deck (Ubuntu 22.04)

## Overview

Administrators occasionally need to run Decko/ActiveRecord scripts against the production deck. Remote shells do not inherit the service environment, so the workflow below standardises how to initialise Ruby, load credentials, and execute a `script/card runner` command without exposing secret infrastructure details in this repository.

---

## One-Line Command Template

```bash
ssh -i <ssh-key> <user>@<deck-host> '
  cd <deck-root> &&
  set -a && source .env.production && set +a &&
  PATH="/home/<user>/.rbenv/shims:$PATH" \
    script/card runner '\''YOUR_RUBY_CODE'\''
'
```

Replace the bracketed placeholders with safe values stored in your password manager. The key ideas are:
- enter the deck directory (`<deck-root>`)
- export environment variables from `.env.production`
- prepend the rbenv shims directory to `PATH`
- invoke `script/card runner` with correctly escaped quotes

---

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **SSH**
   ```bash
   ssh -i <ssh-key> <user>@<deck-host>
   ```

2. **Deck root**
   ```bash
   cd <deck-root>
   ```

3. **Load environment**
   ```bash
   set -a
   source .env.production
   set +a
   ```

4. **Expose rbenv shims**
   ```bash
   PATH="/home/<user>/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"
   ```

5. **Run Decko code**
   ```bash
   script/card runner 'Ruby code here'
   ```

---

## Common Snippets (use with placeholders)

### List sample cards
```bash
script/card runner 'Card.all.limit(20).each { |c| puts "#{c.id}: #{c.name} (#{c.type_name})" }'
```

### Count cards
```bash
script/card runner 'puts "Total cards: #{Card.count}"'
```

### Recent cards
```bash
script/card runner 'Card.order(created_at: :desc).limit(20).each { |c| puts "#{c.id}: #{c.name}" }'
```

### Fetch specific card
```bash
script/card runner '
  card = Card.fetch("Example+Card")
  puts "#{card.id}: #{card.name}"
'
```

Wrap modifications with `Card::Auth.as_bot` when elevated permissions are required.

## Quote Escaping Tips

Remote execution requires three layers of quoting:
1. outer single quotes for the SSH command
2. escaped inner single quotes for the `runner` argument (`'\'' ... '\''`)
3. double quotes inside Ruby for interpolation

Example:
```bash
script/card runner '\''puts "Hello #{ENV.fetch("USER")}"'\''
```

For multi-line snippets, embed newline characters or use a heredoc on the remote host.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/usr/bin/env: 'ruby': No such file or directory` | rbenv shims absent | Prepend the shims directory to `PATH`. |
| `fe_sendauth: no password supplied` | `.env.production` not sourced | Use `set -a && source .env.production && set +a`. |
| `cat: .env.production: No such file or directory` | Wrong working directory | `cd <deck-root>` first. |
| Permission errors when creating cards | Runner executing as default user | Wrap changes in `Card::Auth.as_bot do ... end`. |

---

## Backups (masked example)

Use the same environment bootstrap, then call `pg_dump` against the managed PostgreSQL endpoint recorded in your secrets vault:

```bash
ssh -i <ssh-key> <user>@<deck-host> '
  cd <deck-root> &&
  set -a && source .env.production && set +a &&
  pg_dump -h <rds-endpoint> -U <db-user> -d <db-name> \
    > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
'
```

Download backups with `scp` using the same placeholder values.

## Quick Reference (store securely outside repo)

- SSH key path
- SSH username
- Deck host (public DNS or bastion alias)
- Deck root (e.g., `/home/<user>/magi-archive`)
- rbenv shims path
- Database endpoint, name, and role account

These identifiers are intentionally omitted here to keep the repository free of sensitive infrastructure details.
