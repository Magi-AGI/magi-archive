# Fix for Decko URL parsing that stops at em-dashes and ellipses
#
# ISSUE: URLs in richtext cards get cut short when they contain:
#        - Em-dashes (—)
#        - Ellipses (…)
#        Example: "https://example.com—test" only links "https://example.com"
#
# ROOT CAUSE: Ruby's URI::DEFAULT_PARSER.make_regexp stops at these characters
#             because they're not valid URI characters. The existing trailing
#             punctuation handler only checks single ASCII characters.
#
# SOLUTION: Extend the interpret method to detect and strip multi-character
#           punctuation (em-dashes, ellipses) after the URI match.
#
# APPROACH: Instead of modifying the regex (which would be complex), we
#           post-process the matched chunk to look ahead and capture valid
#           URI characters that appear after the initial match but before
#           actual trailing punctuation.

module UriExtensions
  # Extended punctuation patterns that should be treated as trailing
  EXTENDED_TRAILING_PUNCTUATION = [
    "—",  # Em-dash (U+2014)
    "…",  # Horizontal ellipsis (U+2026)
    "...", # Three periods
  ].freeze

  # Characters that are valid in URIs but might appear after em-dash/ellipsis
  # This helps us determine where the URL actually ends
  URI_VALID_CHARS = /[A-Za-z0-9\-._~:\/\?#\[\]@!$&'()*+,;=%]/

  def interpret(match_start, content)
    # Call original interpret to get the base URI match
    super

    # Now look ahead from where the original match ended to see if there's
    # more URI content after an em-dash or ellipsis
