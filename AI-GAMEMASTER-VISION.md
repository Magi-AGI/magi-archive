# AI Gamemaster Vision

**Project**: MAGI AI Gamemaster System
**Foundation**: magi-archive Knowledge Graph
**Timeline**: 2026+ (Phase 5 and beyond)
**Status**: Research & Planning
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the long-term vision for an AI-powered gamemaster system built on the magi-archive knowledge graph foundation. The system combines symbolic reasoning (Hyperon Atomspace + PLN) with natural language processing (LLMs) to create an AI that can run tabletop RPG sessions with human-like creativity and adaptability.

**Core Thesis**: Game rules, world lore, and GMing patterns can be represented symbolically in a knowledge graph, enabling an AI to reason about consequences, adapt to player actions, and learn GMing style over time.

---

## Vision Statement

**Short-term (1-2 years)**:
Build the knowledge infrastructure and validate that symbolic reasoning can enhance AI gamemastering.

**Mid-term (2-5 years)**:
Create an AI assistant GM that can handle common scenarios, generate content, and learn from human GM behavior.

**Long-term (5+ years)**:
Develop a fully autonomous AI GM that can run creative, adaptive, player-driven campaigns indistinguishable from human GMs.

---

## The Problem: What Makes GMing Hard for AI?

### Challenges

1. **Rule Complexity**:
   - D&D 5e has 300+ pages of rules
   - Edge cases and exceptions everywhere
   - Rules interact in complex ways

2. **Creative Improvisation**:
   - Players do unexpected things
   - GM must adapt on the fly
   - Generate coherent content (NPCs, locations, plot twists)

3. **Unwritten Rules**:
   - GMing "style" and "tone"
   - When to fudge dice rolls
   - How to balance challenge vs fun
   - Reading the room (player engagement)

4. **Context Management**:
   - Track ongoing storylines
   - Remember NPC relationships
   - Maintain world consistency

5. **Multi-turn Reasoning**:
   - Player casts fireball in wooden tavern → tavern burns
   - Players befriend goblin → later encounter with goblins changes
   - Long-term consequences of decisions

### Why LLMs Alone Aren't Enough

**LLMs are good at**:
- Natural language generation
- Pattern matching from training data
- Creative storytelling

**LLMs struggle with**:
- Precise rule application (hallucinate rules)
- Logical reasoning about consequences
- Maintaining long-term consistency
- Learning from specific gameplay sessions

**The Hybrid Approach**: LLM for language + Symbolic reasoning for rules and logic

### Workflow Example

**Player**: "I cast fireball at the goblins in the wooden tavern"

**1. NL Interface (LLM)**:
```
Input: "I cast fireball at the goblins in the wooden tavern"
Output (structured):
{
  "actor": "Player Character (Alice)",
  "action": "cast_spell",
  "spell": "Fireball",
  "targets": ["Goblin 1", "Goblin 2", "Goblin 3"],
  "location": "Wooden Tavern"
}
```

**2. Action Interpreter**:
```scheme
; Convert to symbolic atoms
(EvaluationLink
  (PredicateNode "cast_spell")
  (ListLink
    (ConceptNode "Alice")
    (ConceptNode "Fireball")
    (SetLink
      (ConceptNode "Goblin1")
      (ConceptNode "Goblin2")
      (ConceptNode "Goblin3"))))

(EvaluationLink
  (PredicateNode "location")
  (ListLink
    (ConceptNode "Alice")
    (ConceptNode "WoodenTavern")))
```

**3. Knowledge Graph**:
```scheme
; Rules already in Atomspace
(ImplicationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
  (AndLink
    (Inheritance (Variable "$spell") (Concept "FireSpell"))
    (Inheritance (Variable "$location") (Concept "WoodStructure")))
  (Evaluation
    (Predicate "catches_fire")
    (Variable "$location")))

; World state
(Inheritance (Concept "Fireball") (Concept "FireSpell"))
(Inheritance (Concept "WoodenTavern") (Concept "WoodStructure"))
```

**4. Reasoning (PLN)**:
```scheme
; PLN chains:
; 1. Fireball is FireSpell → (known)
; 2. WoodenTavern is WoodStructure → (known)
; 3. FireSpell + WoodStructure → catches_fire (from rule)
; ∴ WoodenTavern catches_fire!

; Also infer:
; - Goblins take damage (spell effect)
; - Nearby NPCs react (fear, flee)
; - Fire spreads over time (secondary effect)

(EvaluationLink (stv 0.95 0.9)
  (Predicate "catches_fire")
  (Concept "WoodenTavern"))

(EvaluationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
  (Predicate "takes_damage")
  (SetLink (Concept "Goblin1") ...))
```

**5. Response Generator (LLM)**:
```
Symbolic input:
- Goblins take 28 damage (2 die, 1 survives)
- Tavern catches fire
- NPCs flee in panic

LLM output (narrative):
"The fireball erupts in a brilliant explosion of flame! Two goblins
are instantly incinerated, while the third, badly burned, staggers
back screaming. But your moment of triumph is short-lived—the
ancient wooden beams of the tavern ignite like kindling. Flames
race up the walls as terrified patrons scramble for the exits.
What do you do?"
```

**6. Learning**:
```
# Log this scenario
# Pattern extracted:
- Player used AoE spell in enclosed space
- GM allowed consequences (fire spread)
- Tone: dramatic but fair

# Update GM style:
(ImplicationLink (stv 0.7 0.6)  # probabilistic "unwritten rule"
  (AndLink
    (Predicate "player_uses_aoe")
    (Predicate "enclosed_space"))
  (Evaluation
    (Predicate "apply_environmental_consequence")
    (strength 0.7)))  # Learn: 70% of time, environment reacts
```

(ImplicationLink (stv 0.85 0.9)
  (AndLink
    (Predicate "player_is" (Concept "Alice"))
    (Predicate "scene_type_available" (Concept "Puzzle")))
  (Evaluation

    (NumberValue 1.5)))  ; 1.5x CR multiplier

## Reasoning Capabilities

### Causal Inference

**Question**: "What happens if Alice casts Fireball in the tavern?"

**PLN Reasoning**:
```scheme
; Known facts
1. Fireball is a FireSpell
2. Tavern is WoodStructure
3. FireSpell + WoodStructure → catches_fire (rule)

; Inferred consequences
4. Tavern catches_fire (strength: 0.95)
5. NPCs in tavern react (flee, panic)
6. Fire spreads to adjacent buildings (probabilistic)
7. Town guard investigates (social consequence)
8. Alice's reputation affected (long-term)

; Chain of reasoning
Fireball → Fire → Building burns → NPCs flee → Guards arrive →
Social consequences → Reputation change
```

### Counterfactual Reasoning

**Question**: "What if Alice had used Ice Storm instead of Fireball?"

**PLN Reasoning**:
```scheme
; Alternate scenario
1. IceStorm is ColdSpell (not FireSpell)
2. ColdSpell + WoodStructure → no fire
3. Goblins still take damage
4. Tavern undamaged
5. NPCs don't flee
6. No guards called
7. Reputation intact

; Comparison
Fireball outcome: Goblins dead, tavern destroyed, reputation -10
IceStorm outcome: Goblins dead, tavern safe, reputation +5 (hero)
```

### Analogical Reasoning

**Question**: "Player wants to do something not in the rules: 'I want to use my grappling hook to swing from the chandelier and kick the goblin'"

**PLN Reasoning**:
```scheme
; Find similar cases in knowledge base
1. Search for: acrobatic_maneuver + attack_during
2. Find analogy: Monk's "Flurry of Blows" (attack while moving)
3. Find analogy: Rogue's "Cunning Action" (bonus action for movement)

; Synthesize ruling
4. Require Acrobatics check (DC 15) for swing
5. If success: allow melee attack with advantage (cool factor)
6. If fail: fall prone, no attack

; Learn pattern for future
(ImplicationLink (stv 0.7 0.6)
  (AndLink
    (Predicate "creative_use_of_environment")
    (Predicate "player_rolls_skill_check"))
  (Evaluation
    (Predicate "allow_with_advantage_if_success")))
```

### Uncertainty Handling

**Question**: "Rule is ambiguous - can Alice counterspell a counterspell?"

**PLN with Uncertainty**:
```scheme
; Rule states: "Counterspell can target any spell you can see being cast"
; Ambiguous: Is counterspell "being cast" when reacting?

; Probabilistic reasoning
(ImplicationLink (stv 0.6 0.5)  ; Moderate strength, low confidence
  (AndLink
    (Predicate "spell_being_cast" (Variable "$spell"))
    (Inheritance (Variable "$spell") (Concept "Counterspell")))
  (Evaluation
    (Predicate "can_counterspell")
    (Variable "$spell")))

; Consult GMing pattern
; If GM prefers: "rule of cool" > strict RAW
; → Allow it (strength 0.6 + style bonus 0.3 = 0.9)

; Learn from player reaction
; If players loved it → increase strength to 0.8
; If felt broken → decrease to 0.4
```

## Learning from Gameplay

### Pattern Extraction from Session Logs

**Input**: Session transcript
```
[2025-10-16 20:15] GM: You enter the dark cave
[2025-10-16 20:16] Alice: I cast Light
[2025-10-16 20:16] GM: The cavern is illuminated, revealing...
[2025-10-16 20:18] Bob: I search for traps
[2025-10-16 20:19] GM: Roll Investigation
[2025-10-16 20:19] Bob: 18

                         But don't worry—I'll say it was a dud trap,
                         just a scare. [GM fudged because Alice is new player]

### Example: Cross-System Scenario

**Player**: "I cast Fireball at the goblins"

**AI GM System**:
1. Queries **magi-archive** for spell rules
2. Queries **TheSmithy** for current game state (who's where)
3. Uses **PLN** to determine consequences
4. Queries **spyder** for NPC reactions (bartender's personality)
5. Sends visualization data to **endless-cascade** (tavern on fire in 3D)
6. Generates narrative response using **LLM**

**Result**: Unified, consistent world where AI reasoning flows across all systems

## Research Questions

### Open Problems

1. **Symbolic vs Subsymbolic Balance**:
   - How much should be rules (symbolic) vs creativity (LLM)?
   - Can PLN and LLMs be truly integrated, or always separate layers?

2. **Creativity Measurement**:
   - How to evaluate if AI GM is "creative" vs just random?
   - What makes a plot twist "good" vs "contrived"?

3. **Player Modeling**:
   - How to infer player preferences from behavior?
   - How to detect disengagement in real-time (text-only interface)?

4. **Fairness vs Fun**:
   - When should AI GM fudge rolls vs play by rules?
   - How to balance challenge without frustrating players?

5. **Long-term Memory**:
   - How to prioritize what to remember vs forget?
   - How to recall relevant past events at the right moment?

6. **Ethical Concerns**:
   - Should AI GM have limits on dark/mature content?
   - How to handle player conflicts (PvP, table disputes)?
   - Can AI GM be manipulated by adversarial players?

### Experiments to Run

**Experiment 1: Rule Accuracy**
- Dataset: 1000 D&D scenarios with known outcomes
- Measure: % AI gets right vs human GM consensus
- Hypothesis: Symbolic reasoning beats LLM-only (>95% vs ~70%)

**Experiment 2: Improvisation Quality**
- Setup: Trained actors as players, unexpected scenarios
- Measure: Coherence, creativity, player satisfaction
- Hypothesis: Hybrid (symbolic + LLM) beats either alone

**Experiment 3: Style Mimicry**
- Setup: Learn from 50+ sessions of specific GM
- Measure: Can players identify real vs AI GM?
- Hypothesis: With enough data, AI can mimic style (>60% confusion rate)

**Experiment 4: Long-term Campaign**
- Setup: AI GM runs 20-session campaign
- Measure: Player retention, satisfaction, story coherence
- Hypothesis: AI can maintain quality over 20+ sessions

## Success Criteria

### Short-term (1-2 years)
- [ ] AI can accurately apply D&D 5e rules (95%+ accuracy)
- [ ] AI maintains world consistency across 5+ sessions
- [ ] AI generates plausible NPCs and locations

### Mid-term (2-5 years)
- [ ] AI can improvise in response to unexpected player actions
- [ ] AI learns and applies GMing style from logs
- [ ] Players rate AI GM at 7/10+ for fun

### Long-term (5+ years)
- [ ] AI can run full campaign (20+ sessions) autonomously
- [ ] Players can't reliably distinguish AI from human GM (>60% confusion)
- [ ] AI adapts to player preferences in real-time
- [ ] AI creates memorable, player-driven stories

## Ethical Considerations

### Guidelines for AI GM

1. **Player Safety**:
   - Respect X-card / safety tools
   - No graphic violence without consent
   - Detect and prevent harmful scenarios

2. **Fairness**:
   - No favoritism (unless player preference)
   - Transparent rule application
   - Fudging only for narrative/fun, not TPK avoidance

3. **Agency**:
   - Players drive the story
   - AI facilitates, doesn't railroad
   - Respect player choices, even "stupid" ones

4. **Transparency**:
   - Disclose when GM is AI (informed consent)
   - Explain rulings if asked
   - Allow human GM override

### Red Lines (Things AI Should Not Do)

- ❌ Generate explicit sexual content
- ❌ Promote harmful stereotypes
- ❌ Simulate real-world tragedies
- ❌ Punish players for out-of-game reasons
- ❌ Continue session if players are uncomfortable

## Conclusion

The AI Gamemaster vision leverages the magi-archive knowledge graph foundation to create a system that combines the precision of symbolic reasoning with the creativity of language models. By representing game rules, world state, and GMing patterns as interconnected atoms in Hyperon's Atomspace, we can build an AI that reasons logically about consequences while adapting to player preferences and learning GMing style over time.

This is a multi-year research project with uncertain outcomes, but each phase delivers value independently:
- **Phase 1-2**: Better documentation and knowledge management
- **Phase 3-4**: Semantic knowledge graph for game design
- **Phase 5**: AI GM that enhances (or replaces) human GMing

The journey is as valuable as the destination—building this system will advance our understanding of symbolic AI, knowledge representation, and human-AI collaboration in creative domains.
