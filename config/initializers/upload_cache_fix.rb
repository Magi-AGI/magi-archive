# Fix for Decko 0.19.1 file upload bug
#
# ISSUE: Web-based file uploads fail with "Validation failed: File is missing"
#        even though the file is successfully cached in tmp/295/<action_id>.pdf
#
# ROOT CAUSE: The assign_attachment_on_create event doesn't properly retrieve
#             cached files during Stage 2 of Decko's two-stage upload process.
#             CarrierWave's attachment.file remains nil after select_file_revision.
#
# SOLUTION: Override assign_attachment_on_create using prepend to add a disk
#           fallback when CarrierWave fails to hydrate the uploader.
#
# IMPACT ON UPDATES:
# - This fix uses Ruby's prepend to take precedence in method lookup
# - SAFE: If Decko fixes the bug, this fallback will still work (but be unused)
# - REQUIRES TESTING: After any Decko update, test file uploads to ensure compatibility
# - CAN BE REMOVED: Once Decko fixes this upstream, delete this file and restart
#
# TO TEST AFTER UPDATES:
# 1. Upload a PDF through web interface at https://wiki.magi-agi.org
# 2. Check logs: tail -f /home/ubuntu/magi-archive/log/production.log | grep UploadCacheFix
# 3. Should see: "UploadCacheFix: assigning cached file" followed by "Completed 200 OK"
#
# DECKO VERSION: 0.19.1 (2025-10-26)
# REPORTED: https://github.com/decko-commons/decko/issues/... (TODO: file issue)
