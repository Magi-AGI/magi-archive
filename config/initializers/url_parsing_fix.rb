# Fix for URL parsing that stops at em-dashes and ellipses
#
# This initializer loads the URI extensions that allow URLs containing
# em-dashes (—) and ellipses (…) to be properly parsed and linked in
# richtext cards.
#
# TESTING:
# After applying this fix, URLs like these should be fully linked:
# - https://example.com—test
# - https://example.com/path…more
# - https://example.com/page—with-dash/end
#
# TO TEST AFTER UPDATES:
# 1. Create a richtext card with test URLs containing em-dashes and ellipses
# 2. Verify the entire URL (up to the actual trailing punctuation) is clickable
# 3. Check logs if issues occur
#
# VERSION: Decko 0.19.1 (as of 2025-11-06)
